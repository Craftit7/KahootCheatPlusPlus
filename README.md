Hello there!

## NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS FOR LIVE QUIZZES, CHALLENGES COMING SOON

You need to grab the quiz name quickly, or enter it's exact id. In the start of the quiz, the screen of the teacher WILL show the quiz name for 3 seconds. If you didn't manage to get it, try getting the id from the url: blahBlah/blah?quizId=x8-x4-x4-x4-x12.

To download, goto the tags section and to the releases, download the latest one. (Windows Only)
