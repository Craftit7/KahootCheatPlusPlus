# KahootCheat++

Hello there!

## NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS FOR LIVE QUIZZES, CHALLENGES COMING SOON

---

You need to grab the quiz name quickly, or enter it's exact id. In the start of the quiz, the screen of the teacher WILL show the quiz name for 3 seconds. If you didn't manage to get it, try getting the id from the url: blahBlah/blah?quizId=x8-x4-x4-x4-x12.

To download, goto the tags section and to the releases, download the latest one. (Windows Only)

For Linux and MacOS, I cant compile it. You can clone this repo and run npm install, then npm start.

## If you have any issues open an issue
